    On our dashboard, we would like to see the following:<br>
    State of worker role<br>
    Machine counters (CPU Utilization %, RAM available)<br>
    #URL's crawled<br>
    Last 10 URL's crawled<br>
    Size of queue (#urls left in pipeline to be crawled)<br>
    Size of index (Table storage with our crawled data)<br>
    Any errors and their URL's<br><br>

    On the dashboard, we also want the follwing functionality:<br>
    Clear everything (index/table, queue/pipeline, stop all worker roles)<br>
    Start crawling (give a root URL, ex: www.cnn.com and kick off worker roles)<br>
    Retrieve data from index (get page title for specific URL)<br>
